Current design and UI should be improved at the discretion of the designer and approved by the customer representative before implementation. All pages must be responsive (for desktop PC, tablets and smartphones). Desktop view must supports the latest version of Safari, Google chrome, Opera, Mozilla firefox. Support mobile OS: IOS version starting from 8.0, android version starting from 4.1.
   
Front end side must be performed using JS Angular.  
  
API documentation will be provided to customer representative, and should be approved by him before front end part start.   
While API will be preparing on the backend side by customer’s developer, we’ll create a test API using PHP, with some “fish data”. So front end developer will be able to proceed his part of job. 
And when real API will be ready, we’ll be able to switch API from our to customer server.
